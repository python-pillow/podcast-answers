How did you get introduced to Python?
-------------------------------------

In the early 2000s I was working at the National Institutes of Health as a System Administrator and my group needed a website. A neighboring group was using `Plone <http://plone.com>`_ and I decided to copy their approach. Plone is written in Python & built on top various `Zope <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zope>`_ technologies written in Python & C. To customize Plone, you had to know a little Python, so that was my introduction. (Incidentally, that site is still running: https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/.)
